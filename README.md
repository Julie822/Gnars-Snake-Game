## About
The Snake game is a classic arcade-style video game that originated in the late 1970s and became popular in the 1990s with the advent of mobile phones. The game is simple in concept but can be challenging to play.

In a typical Snake game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen and tries to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, and its own body. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the player's objective is to keep the snake alive and growing for as long as possible. The game usually features increasing levels of difficulty, with faster movement speed and more obstacles as the player progresses.

The basic mechanics of a Snake game typically include:

1. Snake movement: The player controls the direction of the snake's movement (usually up, down, left, or right) to navigate the snake around the screen.
2. Food: The snake must eat food that appears randomly on the screen to grow longer and score points.
3. Collision detection: The game checks for collisions between the snake and walls, obstacles, or its own body. If the snake collides with any of these, it's usually game over.
4. Scoring: The player earns points for eating food, and the score may be displayed on the screen.
5. Game over condition: The game ends when the snake collides with a wall, obstacle, or its own body. The player may be given the option to restart the game or exit.
6. Snake games have been implemented in various programming languages and platforms, including desktop computers, mobile phones, and web browsers. They are often used as a simple and fun way to learn programming concepts such as game logic, collision detection, and user input handling.
